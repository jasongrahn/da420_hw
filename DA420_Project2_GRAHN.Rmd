Download Dodger.csv
```{r}
dodgers <- read_csv("dodgers.csv", 
                    col_types = cols(day_of_week = col_factor(levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", 
                                                                         "Wednesday", "Thursday", 
                                                                         "Friday", "Saturday", 
                                                                         "Sunday")),
                                     month = col_factor(levels = c("JAN", "FEB", "MAR", "APR",
                                                                   "MAY", "JUN", "JUL", "AUG",
                                                                   "SEP", "OCT", "NOV", "DEC"))))

use R to develop two side-by-side boxplots, as seen in Figure 2.1 and Figure 2.2
```{r}
#boxplots with ggplot using the dodger data
#day of week on X
#attendence in K's on Y

dodgers %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = day_of_week, y = (attend/1000))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = "pink")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(y = "Attendence in 1000's",
       x = "Day of the Week")

#month on X
#attendence in K's on Y
dodgers %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = month, y = (attend/1000))) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(fill = "blue")) +
  theme_light() +
  theme(legend.position="none") +
  labs(y = "Attendence in 1000's",
       x = "Day of the Week")
```

and two scatter plots, as seen in Figure 2.3 and Figure 2.4
```{r}
