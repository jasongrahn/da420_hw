```

Use TWO of the supervised learning predictive modeling methods (e.g., neural network, support vector machine, and na√Øve Bayes) you choose to do the prediction on the Iris Data Set. 


Use two thirds of data of each class (i.e., Setosa, Versicolour and Virginica) as training set and do the prediction on the rest. 

* Compare the performance (i.e., accuracy) of the two methods. 
* Please describe each method you used, 
* how you separate the training and testing data set, 
* the R/SAS package you used, 
* the performance (i.e., accuracy) comparison of the two methods. 

Make sure you include the commands and outputs, as well as the interpretations of each output.
