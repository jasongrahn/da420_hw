#Part 1
This will be attached separately. 

#Part 2

Consider Exhibit 4.1 in page 50-51. Suppose your client is someone other than the local farmer, a meat producer/butcher, dairy, or brewer perhaps. Determine association rules relevant to your clientâ€™s products guided by the market basket model. What recommendations would you make about future marketplace actions?

```{r}
# Association Rules for Market Basket Analysis (R)

library(arules)  # association rules
library(arulesViz)  # data visualization of association rules
library(RColorBrewer)  # color palettes for plots

data(Groceries)  # grocery transactions object from arules package

# examine frequency for each item with support greater than 0.025
itemFrequencyPlot(Groceries, support = 0.025, cex.names=0.8, xlim = c(0,0.3),
  type = "relative", horiz = TRUE, col = "dark red", las = 1,
  xlab = paste("Proportion of Market Baskets Containing Item",
    "\n(Item Relative Frequency or Support)"))
```

```{r}
# explore possibilities for combining similar items
print(head(itemInfo(Groceries))) 
print(levels(itemInfo(Groceries)[["level1"]]))  # 10 levels... too few 
print(levels(itemInfo(Groceries)[["level2"]]))  # 55 distinct levels

# aggregate items using the 55 level2 levels for food categories
# to create a more meaningful set of items
groceries <- aggregate(Groceries, itemInfo(Groceries)[["level2"]])  

print(dim(groceries)[1])  # 9835 market baskets for shopping trips
print(dim(groceries)[2])  # 55 final store items (categories)  

itemFrequencyPlot(groceries, support = 0.025, cex.names=1.0, xlim = c(0,0.5),

  xlab = paste("Proportion of Market Baskets Containing Item",
    "\n(Item Relative Frequency or Support)"))
```


```{r}
